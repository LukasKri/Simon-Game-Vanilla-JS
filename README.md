## General info
Simon Game was invented by Ralph H. Baer, Howard J. Morrison, and software programming was done by Lenny Cope. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. 

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* DOM
* JavaScript

## Setup
All you need is just a web browser and internet access.

## Gained knowledge
* Basic DOM manipulation via JavaScript:
  * Targeting nodes and its properties and methods
  * Using events for dynamic changes
  * Recursion technique to develop a JavaScript recursive function, which is a function that calls itself
